        Setup react-router, implement Nested routes, 404 page, and Error
        boundary. Set up client-side pagination using randomuser.me API in one
        of your routes called Users - you should show the prev, next, and
        navigation to individual pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. Implement
        accessibility and disabled state and API loading states. The modality of
        submission follows the assignment 1 approach. During which I will give
        you another opportunity to submit Assignment 1 again. C My love for you
